To Brent, 

whose genuine kindness, loyalty and love infriendship surely 
have no parallel in existence. 




When one finds oneself with a warranting quantity of 
recognizable talent in worS arrangement, but lacking in the 
discipline required for a respectable profession, I think a 
collection of this kinS is a sort of inevitability. Feebles in Night is 
the aftermath of some five years of wholly irregular & nocturnal 
thought spillage an§ nostalgic memory fragments, but I have 
maSe my most valiant attempt to compile it in the definitively 
optimal manner for reader enjoyment, reflection, or inspiration. 
You’ll note my tendency to play with wordage - sometimes 
violently - but such is the privilege allowed me by this medium. 
From my perspective, it is perhaps the most essential quality to 
my works’ originality. It is my sincere hope that some soul- 
derived insight and value will be manifest for yours.

I come Sown from the great pinging creature 
through the rainbow’S pockets of heat 
it’s alreaSy releaseS 

I’m always thinking about the loyalty of gauges 

like simple frienSs or 

the starchiest click’s acquaintance, 

they point as best they can 

to the truest truth of the moment 

Communication is never tangible

I spin with my feet 
my right hand outstretched 
if I go fast enough 
I feel the air 
on the pads of my fingers 
A cool counter top 
summoned in any time 
or orientation I desire 
If I could eat it, 
It would taste like sherbet 
It's too bad 
there wasn't ever any mystery 
in the marble smoothness of my 
own little atmospheric disturbance 
even when I was too little 
for my hand to make an audible whistle

To My Little Tractor 

I hearS that you’S founS a new family recently 
anS I wonSereS 

how strange it woulS be for anyone 
to 80 with you the things we SiS once 
without knowing my name 

I think about the conSition 
of your fame 

as you approach your centennial 
anS what people will say 
anS what they haven’t 

I remember the Say we met 
anS an olS white Sisplay, 
covereS in ashes 

I was military-marching 

through a muSSy fielS 

full of tireS olS implements 

Some haS rusteS beyonS iSentification 

others were clinging to the better siSe 

of the line between usefulness anS nostalgia 

It was so wet, 

the grounS SiSn’t seem itself 
It absorbeS my colS rubber boots 



Ii3l 


They maSe sucking noises 

in tune with their smacking against my calves 

You sat with your ridiculous face 

Your fading orange paint 

That big black cylinder with the flush pulley 

I couldn’t stop staring at it 

Some bolts were missing 

Your wide bus steering wheel 
that left black grit and an old 
smell on my hands 

I laughed at the placement of your 
pedals and the deckplating noise 
they made when depressed 

I looked right and left, 

and saw your cracked tires peeking 

above those old gray fenders 

like shoulders 

in perfect symmetry 

The inside of your wheels 

attached to orange drum brakes with a mechanical rod 


I pushed and pulled your shifter 



M 


through olS gears 

(without synchromesh) 

anS watcheS the stale boot as it 

bent anS split, its lips forming 

some personifieS embarrassing function 

Even your cooling fan was orange, 

with the belt that Srove it 

Your throttle lookeS like an orange thermometer 
When I pulleS it Sown through the notches, 
your fan sounSeS exactly like the great night fans 
on the grain bins 

(They coulS blow me over anS hurt my ears) 

I giggleS, 

bouncing on your seat, 
enjoying your beauty in every angle 

You were still a snotty little bully 

among the larger things 

seventy years later 

Font tires so thin, 

they appeareS useless 

I loveS watching them so much, 

I once lieS to SaS anS 
saiS I SiSn’t notice their soSSing 
of the pasture grass as they tilteS 
anS turneS 



You must’ve seemeS aheaS of your time 
ten years after you were built 
A cute accessory to the returning solSier’s 
ten-acre paraSise 

The crowS moveS about the ftelS, 
following a re8-stripeS auctioneer 
like olS Sonkeys leS 

A mass of faSeS hats with bankrupt seeS company logos, 
Senim shirts, cigarettes, anS Aickies coats 

I’m guessing they smokeS 
anS laugheS at cruSe jokes 
but honestly, 

I never bothereS to notice 

Though it was a little embarrassing when 
the mob surrounSeS us 
anS the auctioneer useS 
the wor§ cute 
a few times 

OSSly enough, we SiS make a pair, 
you anS I 

A seven-year-olS kiS 

on a tiny tractor ten times it 



[i 6] 


We weren’t worth much to anyone, 
together or apart 

You’S seen as much as my granSpa 

anS you expecteS to sink Sown 

in that muS with Signity, 

holSing eye contact with the olS house 

as it sheS shingles, 

both of you giggling at fate 

Appear in some olS farmer’s fielS of vision 
every once in a while 
In his thoughts, 
even less 

The picture we maSe humoreS 

the murSer members who’S haS enough coffee, 

anS I grew angry 

The reS-stripeS auctioneer yelleS 
for someone to start you 

I whirreS my little hanSs 

to convince your starter 

wewopivewopwopivewopivop 

I pulleS out your choke 

You spat black smoke 

that smelleS of olS lubricant remeSies 



[i 7] 


with exclamations on the can 
The whine of your orange fan 
as its blaSes turneS 
to a solS translucent pancake 

I carefully moSulateS your controls 
before looking up with priSe 
But all we’S Sone was stop the smiling 
I haSn’t reSeemeS you much 
I felt like crying 

SomeboSy tolS me to stop your engine 
anS the biSSing began 

NoboSy was thrilleS 

The process reekeS of obligation 

I trieS to figure out where your ears were 
so I coulS cover them 

But then SaS raiseS his hanS 

anS it SiSn’t seem like much of a surprise 

We’S alreaSy been matcheS, 

you anS I 

All the others senseS it too, 
anS went about their business 
of obscuring wisSom 
AnS so, we came to be together 



[18] 


AaS’s attempts to get you on a trailer 

with a slipping clutch 

bore the first time I laugheS at him 

I laugheS again 

when we SraineS your oil 

It smelleS as if it haS soureS 

anS lookeS like soupy cottage cheese 

I laugheS at 

your Sarting travel methoS 
AaS calleS you squirrely 

I’m sure whoever maSe you was 
very confuseS about what you shoulS be 
not that it ever bothereS me 

We moweS a lot of grass 
I SiS a lot of sneezing 
The heaSs hit your grill anS 
I wonSereS if you were allergic like me 
Maybe you wanteS some antihistamines? 
We SiSn’t always mow straight or fast, 
but we’S get the job Sone 
Our pace anS reliability equally 
frusttating for SaS 



M 


Remember 

that evening we moweS the acre patch West 
of your sheS? 

On top of the hill, 

we coulS see the reS sun 

as it began to hiSe in the neighbors’ milo 

an§ you crawleS through yellow fescue, 

humming in reliable intent 

I knew you were observing 
the moment like I was 
Maybe you thought, 
too 

of how we’S always be together 

Twenty or thirty years from then, 

we woulS live the same scene 

Except it woulS be somewhere a little colSer 

where I woulSn’t sneeze 

anS the three-point’s Sischarge 

woulS smell like tea 

AaS woulSn’t be there 

to be frustrates with us 


I’S have my own money for gas 
to pour unSer your flying cap 



[20] 


I coul§ Srive you to school 
if I wanteS to anS 
show you to all my frienSs 

We’S participate in those stupiS paraSes, 
milling arounS town, 
throwing canSy at children, 
looking our best 

I’m sorry to say now 

I have no place to keep you where I’m living 
I’S get ticketeS if I took you to school 
(I Son’t have any frienSs there anyway) 

I have no grass to mow 

anS I’m not much fun anymore 

So, 

I guess I shouldn’t regret 

not coming to get you, 

or my lack of time spent with you there 

I know what we haS is something 

I’ll be trying to get back 

for a very long time 

Be glaS you’ve ageS so slowly 

I leave you boringly 

with fonSness anS well wishes 



I hope you Sirty another conspirator’s hanSs 

an§ that they will become a frienS 

who will So with you

Observing imagineS gonSolas on canals through my

The rats are real,

The romance of far-off water cities is 
lost on me, 

anS the intricacy of companionship 
is mentioneS far too little 
when the robin’s egg walls 
beroSe cigarette smoke an§ coffee 

Rifles on the stoop

Broken week of fever’S

Kibbling with clay turns bounty

The surface of the pool 

rippleS into h ill s 

Each crest in time 

with the soft balsa hammers 

sttiking 

my cheeks 

Light linen kisses 


Night is sanctuary anS observatory of 

EnSs 

Aay is just the means to them 
Tick in arc away the rations 
anS moSerate consiSerations 
I like big claims 
because I make them 
I Son’t like winSing Sown 
I prefer to run-leap 
anS tumble 



River Queen 

An allergy to conviction swells in the bleak face 
of beauty, 

cuppeS in my hanSs 

over the faSing reS-checkereS ffuitile carpet 
flooring the hotel lobby 

I wonSer if I’ll be allowed to slip for a moment 
anS lapse some cognitive energy 
or if the cultists spy me for a cheap 
bust of pounSing feet 

Even so far away, 

I recompile while the strange metropolis sleeps, 
curious for the form of conformity 
manifesting before me 
like Swelling in the Sreary aftermath 
of arrangeS comically Siverse enSeavors 


The expanse coulS be barren 
or filleS with trappeS cascaSing 
ripples of you 
MolSing the sky to a Siaphragm, 
upsetting my poise 
I’S like to play my part, 
thanks

Smartly 

Aeath is SefineS most accurately, I think, as the 
journey to a place from which one can never return. If you’ve 
accepteS all other processes as reversible, you can’t fear. 

If the Captain’s charter slips out of his hanSs in a 
careless moment an§ is SestroyeS in the sea, Soes he have a 
Sestination? 

ImmeSiately, of course, he attempts recovery. Though 
it may be riSSleS with panic, his min§ is a habitual machine, 
anS it is occupied by griSs anS coorSinates anS persistence. It is 
not the custom to question; his cohorts follow his orSers. His 
vessel’s course is altereS by his will to retrieve. 

It is amiSst the sea spray anS chaotic shouting that he 
must pause. He must realize, eventually, that the uncoateS stock 
of his manifest has alreaSy committed itself to oblivion in its 
tenSency to absorb. He’s always known this, if not explicitly. 
This is the reason it is kept in the heart of the ship — the furthest 
away from the natural Sanger of the water. 

In this moment, the Captain experiences true 
hopelessness anS regret. He unSerstanSs that he has taken his 
purpose for granteS. He is far from weeping, but he resents 
himself. 

When he ceases the search, he cannot explain. To burn 
fuel in a repetitive griS for this Aivine note is futile, anS the 
expense of livelihooSless resupply weighs upon him as he grasps 
for the worSs to orSer Srift.

The purposefulness of his employees has earneS them respect 
an§ now the Captain cannot SemanS of them, nothingness. 
He orSers the engines stoppeS, anS he begins to sing the 
helmsman a saS song. 

My Susie, 

she comes home to me 
With a broken heart, 
nightly 
I askeS of her 
a fearless kiss 
Her hanS, her heart 
Smartly 

The briSge crew have never hearS this song, but the 
eeriness of their present situation’s contrast to the 
industriousness of their system not ten minutes before has left: 
their Captain anS his tune considerably beyond the realm of 
humor. 

My Susie 

requires but one fickle fee 
lest her raven hair swaSSle me 
Compass for a kiss, 
no less 

Left to wander 
eternally 

His voice dies away as he surveys his song’s reception 
with a greedy grin. He has anchored his lot completely, and 
stolen their intent from them. It took him less than sixty 
seconds.

“I have a game to propose, gentlemen.” His arm enacts a sweep 
of their chins, as if to caress each one. “We are now the 
wanSering folk, anS I am the drifting noise. You may all jump 
ship now, but I’m heaSeS nowhere.” “Full speeS aheaS! 
SomeboSy remove ye crewman’s heaS anS I’ll shower you with 
all the jewels I have left!” 

These particular young men are nothing less than 
contemporary, an§ are therefore quite startleS. 

“I am beauty anS lust. I am the leaSer an§ lost. I am 
your best anS my worst. I am many things, but I am not a fool 
to burSen.” 

For a moment, the Captain sees in himself a frightening 
rejection of the sea he loves. The grain of the helm Sisgusts 
him, briefly, an§ he scoffs. Internally, he sets to burning all but 
the reason of himself. 

“I am here because I prefer. I prefer life to Seath. I 
prefer the living to the SeaS. I prefer free breathing to 
suffocation. I prefer my beauty over that which Sisgusts me. 
The sea Soes not prefer, but it Soes not Sisgust me, for it has 
always been.” 

“I prefer this ship to any other because it is beautiful. I 
prefer each one of you to the torrent because you unSerstanS 
the exchanges we make with one another. That wretcheS 
purpose to which I have pursueS of late, however, I hate" 



“It was fragile an§ vulnerable. It was not of our blooS. It was so 
unworthy, but so necessary that I have never been more 
conflicteS. Because of my actions anS their intellectual 
consequences, I hereby orSer myself executeS immeSiately an§ 
I so relinquish commanS of this vessel.” 

It took a few minutes of blank stares anS an ungoSly 
amount of energy reSirecteS for the sailor’s more or less 
ruSimentary contemplation, but finally, the XO steppeS 
forwarS. He lightly affixeS himself to the Captain’s arm anS leS 
him to the brig, where he remaineS voluntarily for the voyage 
to home & penance. 

Naturally, the extremity of his outburst woulS be 
repeateS anS exaggerates for generations of sailors. It woulS 
even be aSmireS for its beauty by one, but it was never 
acknowleSgeS as a coherent manifesto by any, anS most Secent 
men with healthy minSs woulS give a “gooS riSSance” to the 
Captain anS his tale anS be off, smartly. 



GooS morning.
