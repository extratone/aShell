To Brent, 

whose genuine kindness, loyalty and bve in friendship surely 
have no parallel in existence. 











When one finSs oneself with a warranting quantity of 
recognizable talent in worS arrangement, hut lacking in the 
Siscipline requireS for a respectable profession, I think a 
collection of this kinS is a sort of inevitahility. Peebles in Ni^ is 
the aftermath of some five years of wholly irr^ular & nocturnal 
thought spill^e anS nostalgic memory fiagments, hut I have 
maSe my most valiant attempt to compile it in the Sefinitively 
optimal manner for reaSer enjoyment, reflection, or inspiration. 
You’ll note my tenSency to play with worS^e - sometimes 
violently - hut such is the privil^e alloweS me hy this meSium. 
From my perspective, it is perhaps the most essential quality to 
my works’ originality. It is my sincere hope that some soul- 
SeriveS insight anS value will he manifest for yours.

To My Little Tractor 

I hearS that you’S founS a new family recently 
anS I wonSereS 

how strange it woulS be for anyone 
to So with you the things we SiS once 
without knowing my name 

I think about tbe conSition 
of your fame 

as you approach your centennial 
anS what people will say 
anS what they haven’t 

I remember the Say we met 
anS an olS white Sisplay, 
covereS in ashes 

I was military-marching 

through a muSSy fielS 

full of tireS olS implements 

Some haS rusteS beyonS iSentification 

others were clinging to tbe better siSe 

of tbe line between usefulness anS nostalgia 

It was so wet, 

tbe grounS SiSn’t seem itself 
It absorbeS my colS mbber boots 


They maSe sucking noises 

in mne with their smacking against my calves 

You sat with your riSiculous face 

Your faSing orange paint 

That big black cylinSer with the flush pulley 

I coulSn’t stop staring at it 

Some bolts were missing 

Your wiSe bus steering wheel 
that left: black grit anS an olS 
smell on my hanSs 

I laugheS at the placement of your 
peSals anS the Seckplating noise 
they maSe when SepresseS 

I lookeS right anS left, 

anS saw your crackeS tires peeking 

above those olS gray fenSers 

like shoulSers 

in perfect symmetry 

The insiSe of your wheels 

attaches to orange Srum brakes with a mechanical roS 


I pusheS anS pulleS your shifter 










[i4l 


through olS gears 

(without synchromesh) 

anS watcheS the stale hoot as it 

hent anS split, its lips forming 

some personifies embarrassing function 

Even your cooling fan was orange, 

with the belt that Srove it 

Your throttle lookeS like an orange thermometer 
When I puUeS it Sown through the notches, 
your fan sounSeS exactly like the great night fans 
on the grain bins 

(They coulS blow me over anS hurt my ears) 

I gi^leS, 

bouncing on your seat, 
enjoying your beauty in every angle 

You were still a snotty little bully 

among the larger firing 

seventy years later 

Font tires so thin, 

they appeareS useless 

I loveS watching them so much, 

I once lieS to SaS anS 
saiS I SiSn’t notice their soSSing 
of the pasture grass as they tilteS 
anS turneS 


You must’ve seemeS aheaS of your time 
ten years after you were built 
A cute accessory to the remming solSier’s 
ten-acre paraSise 

The crowS moveS about the fielS, 
following a reS-stripeS auctioneer 
like olS Sonkeys leS 

A mass of faSeS hats with bankmpt seeS company logos, 
Senim shirts, cigarettes, anS Aickies coats 

I’m guessing they smokeS 
anS laugheS at cmSe jokes 
but honestly, 

I never bothereS to notice 

Though it was a little embarrassing when 
the mob surrounSeS us 
anS the auctioneer useS 
the worS cute 
a few times 

OSSly enough, we SiS make a pair, 
you anS I 

A seven-year-olS kiS 

on a tiny tractor ten times it 










[i6l 


We weren’t worth much to anyone, 
together or apart 

You’S seen as much as my granSpa 

anS you expecteS to sink Sown 

in that muS with Signity, 

holSing eye contact with the olS house 

as it sheS shingles, 

both of you giggling at fate 

Appear in some olS farmer’s fielS of vision 
every once in a while 
In his thoughts, 
even less 

The picture we maSe humoreS 

the murSer members who’S haS enough coffee, 

anS I grew angry 

The reS-stripeS auctioneer yelleS 
for someone to start you 

I whirreS my little hanSs 

to convince your starter 

wewopwewopwopwewopwop 

I puUeS out your choke 

You spat black smoke 

that smelleS of olS lubricant remeSies 


I 17 I 


with exclamations on the can 
The whine of your orange fan 
as its blaSes turneS 
to a sols translucent pancake 

I carefully moSulateS your controls 
before looking up with priSe 
But all we’S Sone was stop the smiling 
I haSn’t reSeemeS you much 
I felt like crying 

SomeboSy tolS me to stop your engine 
anS the biSSing began 

NoboSy was thrilleS 

The process reekeS of obligation 

I trieS to figure out where your ears were 
so I coulS cover them 

But then SaS raiseS his hanS 

anS it SiSn’t seem like much of a surprise 

We’S alreaSy been matcheS, 

you anS I 

All the others senseS it too, 
anS went about their business 
of obscuring wisSom 
AnS so, we came to be together 










[181 


AaS’s attempts to get you on a trailer 

with a slipping clutch 

hore the first time I laugheS at him 

I laugheS again 

when we SraineS your oil 

It smelleS as if it haS soureS 

anS lookeS like soupy cottage cheese 

I laugheS at 

your Sarting travel methoS 
AaS calleS you squirrely 

I’m sure whoever maSe you was 
very confuseS about what you shoulS he 
not that it ever hothereS me 

We moweS a lot of grass 
I SiS a lot of sneezing 
The heaSs hit your grill anS 
I wonSereS if you were allergic like me 
Maybe you wanteS some antihistamines? 
We SiSn’t always mow straight or fast, 
but we’S get the job Sone 
Our pace anS reliability equally 
frustrating for SaS 


I 19 I 


Remember 

that evening we moweS the acre patch West 
of your sheS? 

On top of the hill, 

we coulS see the reS sun 

as it began to hiSe in the neighbors’ milo 

anS you crawleS through yellow fescue, 

humming in reliable intent 

I knew you were observing 
the moment like I was 
Maybe you thought, 
too 

of how we’S always be together 

Twenty or thirty years from then, 

we words live the same scene 

Except it words be somewhere a litde colSer 

where I woulSn’t sneeze 

anS the three-point’s Sischarge 

words smell like tea 

AaS woulSn’t be there 

to be frustrates with us 

rS have my own money for gas 
to pour unSer your flying cap 










[20l 


I coulS Srive you to school 
if I wanteS to anS 
show you to all my If ienSs 

We’S participate in those stupiS paraSes, 
milling arounS town, 
throwing canSy at chilSren, 
looking our best 

I’m sorry to say now 

I have no place to keep you where I’m living 
rS get ticketeS if I took you to school 
(I Son’t have any ffienSs there anyway) 

I have no grass to mow 

anS I’m not much fiin anymore 

So, 

I guess I shoulSn’t regret 

not coming to get you, 

or my lack of time spent with you there 

I know what we haS is something 

I’ll he trying to get hack 

for a very long time 

Be glaS you’ve ageS so slowly 

I leave you Sotingly 

with fonSness anS well wishes 


I hope you Sirty another conspirator’s hanSs 

anS that they will become a frienS 

who will 8o with you 

all the things little boys 

anS little tractors shoulS So 


Pain is a Sisease 
Pick one tree,

Earth curves away too soon

By ill luminate 

the suspea anS spectacle

Every Sistraaion falls away

Caught always after

Aefault equations writ the

PeSestrian soliSity is 
past 

when the grain of the street 
is swept in my hour 

My hour, 

when the city’s 

too cols for the lonely

anS the contrast 

of the contact 

you won’t have 

owns one 

for a moment of 

serenity amongst 

splinteS trees anS

Flailing through my seconS Earth

On Serenity 

My silence is cosmic 

anS my peace is the morning 

I am the mountain 

anS its roaS 

I am the unseen envy 

of the unseen man 

My hreath is rare 

anS my hanSs are poets 

You coulS imagine the Holy night 

anS its sheSSing 

When all the energy has gone 

anS the streets are swept, 

I am life anS Seath 
anS home 

I was tolS I’m not at peace 
of all things 

me, not co-existing with the sleeping streets 
every night while you were resting 
anS seeking them in Steams which you chase away 

Not at peace with the trenches 
I cross every Say 
that I helpeS Sig 
or the burrowing into the emhraceless hlack like a 

wanSering wraith 
The howl of pause I volitiously jumpeS in 











The Other Woman 


Aelicate whisper notes 
Fr^ile cry^stalline jewels 
in freefalling tumble 
Sown to my lips 

They hang there 

in a minor wail 

The surface of the pool 

rippleS into hil ls 

Each crest in time 

with the soft balsa hammers 

striking 

my cheeks 

Light linen kisses 


Night is sancmary anS observatory of 

EnSs 

Aay is just the means to them 
Tick in arc away the rations 
anS moSerate consiSerations 
I like big claims 
because I make them 
I Son’t like winSing Sown 
I prefer to mn-leap

River Queen 

An allergy to conviction swells in the bleak face 
of beauty, 

cuppeS in my hanSs 

over the faSing reS-checkereS ftuitile carpet 
flooring the hotel lobby 

I wonSer if I’ll be alloweS to slip for a moment 
anS lapse some cognitive energy 
or if the cultists spy me for a cheap 
bust of pounSing feet 

Even so far away, 

I recompile while the strange metropolis sleeps, 
curious for the form of conformity 
manifesting before me 
like Swelling in the Sreary aftermath 
of arranges comically Siverse enSeavors 


The expanse coulS be barren 
or filleS with trappeS cascaSing 
ripples of you 
MolSing the sl^ to a Siaphr^m,

Smartly 

Aeath is SefineS most accurately, I think, as the 
journey to a place from which one can never return. If you’ve 
accepteS all other processes as reversible, you can’t fear. 

If the Captain’s charter slips out of his hanSs in a 
careless moment anS is SestroyeS in the sea, Soes he have a 
Sestination? 

ImmeSiately, of course, he attempts recovery. Though 
it may be riSSleS with panic, his minS is a habitual machine, 
anS it is occupieS by griSs anS coorSinates anS persistence. It is 
not the custom to question; his cohorts follow his orSers. His 
vessel’s course is altereS by his will to retrieve. 

It is amiSst the sea spray anS chaotic shouting that he 
must pause. He must realize, eventually, that the uncoateS stock 
of his manifest has alreaSy committeS itself to oblivion in its 
tenSency to absorb. He’s always known this, if not explicitly. 
This is the reason it is kept in the heart of the ship — the furthest 
away from the natural Sanger of the water. 

In this moment, the Captain experiences tme 
hopelessness anS r^et. He unSerstanSs that he has taken his 
purpose for granteS. He is far from weeping, but he resents 
himself 

When he ceases the search, he cannot explain. To burn 
fuel in a repetitive griS for this Aivine note is futile, anS the 
expense of livelihooSless resupply weighs upon him as he grasps 
for the worSs to orSer Srift. 


The purposefulness of his employees has earneS them respect 
anS now the Captain cannot SemanS of them, nothingness. 
He orSers the engines stoppeS, anS he begins to sing the 
helmsman a saS song. 

My Susie, 

she comes home to me 
With a broken heart, 
nightly 
I asked of her 
a fearless kiss 
Her hand, her heart 
Smartly 

The briSge crew have never hearS this song, but the 
eeriness of their present situation’s contrast to the 
inSustriousness of their system not ten minutes before has left: 
their Captain anS his tune consiSerably beyonS the realm of 
humor. 

My Susie 

requires but one fickle fee 
lest her raven hair swaddle me 
Compass for a kiss, 
no less 

Lefi to wander 
eternally 

His voice Sies away as he surveys his song’s reception 
with a greeSy grin. He has anchoreS his lot completely, anS 
stolen their intent from them. It took him less than sixty 
seconSs.

“I have a game to propose, gentlemen.” His arm enacts a sweep 
of their chins, as if to caress each one. “We are now the 
wanSering folk, anS I am the Srifting noise. You may all jump 
ship now, hut I’m heaSeS nowhere.” “Full speeS aheaS! 
SomehoSy remove ye crewman’s heaS anS I’ll shower you with 
all the jewels I have left!” 

These particular young men are nothing less than 
contemporary, anS are therefore quite startleS. 

“I am heauty anS lust. I am the leaSer anS lost. I am 
your best anS my worst. I am many things, hut I am not a fool 
to hurSen.” 

For a moment, the Captain sees in himself a frightening 
rejection of the sea he loves. The grain of the helm Sisgusts 
him, briefly, anS he scoffs. Internally, he sets to burning all but 
the reason of himself 

“I am here because I prefer. I prefer life to Seath. I 
prefer the living to the SeaS. I prefer ftee breathing to 
suffocation. I prefer my beauty over that which Sisgusts me. 
The sea Soes not prefer, but it Soes not Sisgust me, for it has 
always been.” 

“I prefer this ship to any other because it is beautiful. I 
prefer each one of you to the torrent because you unSerstanS 
the exchanges we make with one another. That wretcheS 
purpose to which I have pursueS of late, however, I hate^

“It was fragile anS vulnerable. It was not of our blooS. It was so 
unworthy, but so necessary that I have never been more 
confliaeS. Because of my actions anS their intellectual 
consequences, I hereby orSer myself executeS immeSiately anS 
I so relinquish commanS of this vessel.” 

It took a few minutes of blank stares anS an ungoSly 
amount of energy reSireaeS for the sailor’s more or less 
mSimentary contemplation, but finally, the XO steppeS 
forwarS. He lightly affixeS himself to the Captain’s arm anS leS 
him to the brig, where he remaineS voluntarily for the voyage 
to home & penance. 

Namrally, the extremity of his outburst woulS be 
repeateS anS exaggerates for generations of sailors. It woulS 
even be aSmireS for its beauty by one, but it was never 
acknowleSgeS as a coherent manifesto by any, anS most Secent 
men with healthy minSs woulS give a “gooS riSSance” to the 
Captain anS his tale anS be off, smartly. 


AnS so, I shall. 










GooS morning.
