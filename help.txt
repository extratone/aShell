a-Shell is a terminal emulator for iOS, with many Unix commands: ls, pwd, tar, mkdir, grep....

a-Shell can do most of the things you can do in a terminal, locally on your iPhone or iPad. You can redirect command output to a file with ">" (append with ">>") and you can pipe commands with "|".

 - Single-finger swipes move the cursor or scroll, two-finger swipes send keyboard input (up, down, escape, tab). "man gestures" for more.

- customize appearance with config
- pickFolder: open, bookmark and access a directory anywhere (another app, iCloud, WorkingCopy, file providers...)
- newWindow: open a new window
- exit: close the current window

- Edit files with vim and ed.
- Transfer files with curl, tar, scp and sftp.
- Clone repositories and do version control with lg2 (uses libgit2).
- Process files with python3, lua, jsc, clang, pdflatex, lualatex.
- Open files in other apps with open, play sound and video with play, preview with view.
- For network queries: nslookup, ping, host, whois, ifconfig...
